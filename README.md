# RAIS

**RAIS** (Runtime for AI Scheduling; رئيس) is a C++20 scheduling runtime for
low-latency AI inference on Apple Silicon. It sits between your inference engine
and the hardware, deciding what runs, when, and on which resource — so that
user-facing requests stay fast even when the system is under load.

## The problem

Running LLMs in production on Apple Silicon surfaces three bottlenecks that
inference engines don't solve on their own:

1. **Contention between requests.** When multiple prompts arrive at once, a
   naive FIFO queue makes real-time users wait behind long batch jobs.
   Benchmarks on Llama-3.2-1B with 6 concurrent clients show users waiting
   ~4.8 seconds for their first token when background work is ahead of them.

2. **SSD-to-GPU stalls.** Loading model weights layer-by-layer from disk is
   sequential by default — the GPU sits idle while each layer reads in. On
   real LLM weights (SmolLM2-135M, TinyLlama-1.1B), RAIS's IO pipeline
   delivers **1.15–1.20x higher throughput** by overlapping disk reads with
   compute.

3. **Model switching downtime.** Swapping between models (e.g. changing
   assistant persona or loading a fine-tune) normally requires draining all
   in-flight requests before unloading. With RAIS, the new model loads in the
   background on a dedicated task while the old model keeps serving.

## What RAIS does

RAIS provides a task scheduler with five priority lanes that map directly to
the different classes of work in an inference server:

| Lane | Target | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `Interactive` | < 5ms submit-to-start | Real-time user requests |
| `Background` | Best-effort | Model hot-swap, logging, embeddings |
| `Bulk` | Deferred | Batch jobs, eval runs |
| `GPU` | Metal async | Compute kernel dispatch |
| `IO` | Dedicated threads | SSD weight reads, never blocks CPU |

When a real-time request arrives while batch jobs are queued, RAIS jumps it
to the front. In the 6-client benchmark above, this reduces interactive TTFT
from **4,829ms to 1,438ms — a 3.4x improvement** with no change to total
throughput.

## How it works

### Priority scheduling
The scheduler maintains a lock-free MPMC ring for normal tasks and a separate
min-heap for deadline tasks (served earliest-deadline-first). Each worker
checks its local Chase-Lev deque, then the deadline heap, then the global
queue, then steals from a random peer. Interactive tasks beat Background tasks
beat Bulk tasks — with starvation promotion (100ms / 500ms) ensuring low-
priority work eventually completes.

### IO pipeline
`Lane::IO` tasks run on a dedicated thread pool (default: 2 threads) with
their own MPMC queue, completely isolated from CPU compute workers. Reads use
`pread()` for thread safety and `F_NOCACHE` to bypass the kernel page cache —
layer weights are used once per forward pass and shouldn't evict hot data.

### Layer streaming
`LayerStreamer` maintains a triple-buffered ring of GPU buffers. While the
GPU computes layer N, layer N+1 is already in a Metal buffer, and layer N+2
is being read from SSD. The IO lane drives the reads; the GPU lane drives
compute. Neither stalls waiting for the other.

### Model hot-swap
`ModelManager` submits a new model load as a `Background` task. The old model
keeps serving `Interactive` requests throughout. On success, the old model
unloads atomically and the ready callback fires. Concurrent swap requests
cancel the in-flight load and take over cleanly.

### Memory management
A lock-free slab allocator handles task objects at ~83ns per alloc
(~124M ops/sec), eliminating `make_shared` overhead on the hot path.
`MetalBufferPool` buckets GPU buffers by size class (4KB–256MB) and reuses
them across forward passes, eliminating the per-layer `newBufferWithLength:`
cost. `MemoryMonitor` tracks pool utilization against a configurable budget
with Warning/Critical thresholds for backpressure signaling.

**Concurrent request scheduling** (Llama-3.2-1B-Instruct-4bit, 6 clients,
3 interactive / 3 background, background batch pre-queued):

| Metric | Naive FIFO | RAIS Priority | Speedup |

| Interactive E2E | 5,653 ms | 2,254 ms | **2.5x** |

**Layer-streaming throughput** (real weight files, IO/compute overlapped):

| Model | Naive | RAIS | Speedup |
|---|---|---|---|

| TinyLlama-1.1B (2.1 GB, 23 layers) | 15.5 tok/s | 17.8 tok/s | **1.15x** |

**Subsystem microbenchmarks:**

| Slab allocator alloc (single thread, p50) | 83 ns |
| Scheduler Interactive dispatch (p50) | 228 µs |
